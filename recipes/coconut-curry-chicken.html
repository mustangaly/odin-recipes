                <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp lime juice</li>
                <li>2 tsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cilantro and/or basil, diced</li>
                <li>fine sea salt and freshly cracked pepper</li>
                <li>Serve over/with: cooked basmati rice, naan bread, lime wedges</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep all the ingredients: mince the garlic and ginger, dice the onion, slice the red bell pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tbsp coconut oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for 3-5 minutes or until they turn golden.</li>
                <li>Add the ginger and garlic. Stir to coat everything with the coconut oil.Reduce heat to low, add the red curry paste, curry powder, and coriander. Stir frequently for 2-3 minutes, or until the dish is fragrant and lightly toasted. </li>
                <li>Return the heat to medium-high. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of coconut oil and the red pepper. Stir for a few minutes, then add the bite-sized chicken pieces.</li>
                <li>Add salt and pepper to taste. (I add 1 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper.) Cook the chicken, stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until the chicken is browned on each side, not fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Add brown sugar, coconut milk, water chestnuts, pineapple chunks, lime juice, and fish sauce.</li>
                <li>Let simmer for ten minutes to ensure chicken is fully cooked through. This also allows the flavors to combine and the curry sauce to thicken.</li>
             </ol>
