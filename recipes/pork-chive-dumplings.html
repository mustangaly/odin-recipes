                <li>1 tbsp minced garlic </li>
                <li>2 tsp minced raw ginger</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 small bunch of scallions divided</li>
                <li>3 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp Chinese five spice (optional)</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 pk round wonton/dumpling wrappers</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take half of a bunch of scallions and chop completely (whites and greens). Set the other half aside for use as a garnish. Add the sesame oil to a pan and saute over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic, ginger, and chopped scallions. Cook until fragrant for about 1 minute to remove the raw taste from the ingredients withoug cooking them. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, hoisin and soy sauces, Chinese five spice, and the egg. Mix until uniform.</li>
                <li>Place about 1 1/2 tsp of the pork mixture into the center of each dumpling. Brush a little water around the edge of the wonton with your finger. Seal the dumpling shut by pinching the sides together, making sure to get all the excess air out.</li>
                <li>Once the dumpling is shut and sealed, create the pleats using your thumb and forefinger. Repeat with the rest of the wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat with oil. Place dumplings into hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes. Remove and drain over paper towels.</li>
                <li>Place dumplings back into pan and add 1/2 cup of wate so that ir rises up the dumplings about halfway. Cover and steam for 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Use the remaining chopped scallions as a garnish, and serve immediately with your favorite sauce. Enjoy!</li>
