        <p>A deliciously creamy Greek chicken soup with dill, lemon, and eggs.</p>
        <p>Avgolemono is one of my favorite things to make because it is super nutritious, relatively inexpensive, and easy to put together! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 chicken breasts, whole</li>
                <li>2-3 carrots, cut into 1-inch slices</li>
                <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of rice</li>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup of lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of minced fresh dill</li>
                <li>Dill sprigs (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Fill a stock pot half to two-thirds of the way with water. Place the chicken breasts, minced dill, and 2-3 bay leaves in the pot, cover, and simmer for one hour.</li>
                <li>While the chicken is cooking, cut all the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken breasts out of the pot. Set aside to shred after they cool for several minutes.</li>
                <li>Bring the remaining broth to a boil, add salt to taste. Add the vegetables and rice, cover, and simmer for 20 mins.</li>
                <li>While the rice is cooking, shred the chicken. If you have a Kitchen Aid, the dough mixer attachement works perfectly for this.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs, add the lemon juice slowly while stirring. The lemon juices acts to prime the egg-whites to help prevent curdling.</li>
                <li>Take two cups of broth from the pot and SLOWLY add to the egg/lemon mixture while stirring constantly. This heats the eggs up slowly so it won't curdle when you add it into the soup.</li>
                <li>When the eggs and the broth are well-incorporated, pour the mixture back into the broth while stirring.</li>
                <li>Add the shredded chicken, and allow the soup to simmer for a couple of minutes so the flavors can combine.</li>
                <li>Serve in bowls, garnish with fresh ground pepper and dill sprigs. Enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
